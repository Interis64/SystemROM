## System Calls

To make a system call (syscall), load the system call number into memory at `$FFFF` and issue a `RST $10` instruction.
See the documentation for each syscall below for information on passing parameters and results.

| Call Number | Function                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|         $00 | Reserved                                                |
|         $02 | Reset                                                   |
|         $04 | Start Debug Monitor                                     |
|         $06 | Print character to output device                        |
|         $08 | Print null-terminated string to output device           |
|         $0A | Read a character from BufferedInput                     |
|         $0C | Check if there's a character available in BufferedInput |
|         $0E | Write a character into the input buffer                 |
|         $10 | System Bell                                             |
|         $12 | NVRAM Read Byte                                         |
|         $14 | NVRAM Write Byte                                        |
|         $16 | Serial Send Byte                                        |

### $02 Reset
Clears the input buffer, clears the screen, displays the ROM header message, attempts to boot from a storage device, falls back to the system monitor if that fails.

### $04 Start Debug
Breaks out of the current program to the system monitor for debugging.

### $06 Print character to output device
Writes the byte of data in the `A` register to the primary output device.
By default, this is the serial port, but hardware drivers may override this call to become the default device.

### $08 Print null-terminated string to output device
Writes a string of characters starting at `(HL)` to the primary output device via repeated calls to syscall $06.
Execution continues until a null byte is encountered, which is not sent.
See the documentation for syscall $06 for information on output devices.

### $0A Read a character from BufferedInput
Removes the first character from the input buffer and stores it in the `A` register.
If no character is available in the buffer, this call will block until one becomes available.

### $0C Check if there's a character available in BufferedInput
Checks to see if there are characters in the input buffer.
If there are characters in the buffer, the `Z` flag will be cleared, otherwise `Z` will be set.
Additionally, `A` will contain the number of characters in the buffer.

### $0E Write a character into the input buffer
Inserts the character in the `A` register into the input buffer.
If the input buffer is full, this call is silently ignored.

### $10 System Bell
Sounds the system bell.
By default this is a simple beep from the on-board speaker generated by the NVRAM chip.
Audio device drivers can override this call to provide their own system bell.

### $12 NVRAM Read Byte
TODO: Document system call

### $14 NVRAM Write Byte
TODO: Document system call

### $16 Serial Send Byte
Writes the byte of data in the `A` register to the serial port.
By default, this is the same as syscall $06, but this is made available separately for cases where the default output has been redirected by a device driver.

### $18 Serial Receive Byte
Receives a byte of data from the serial port in the `A` register.
By default, this points to BufferedInput.Accept, so serial data is passed through the input buffer.
Applications can overwrite this to handle serial data on their own.
